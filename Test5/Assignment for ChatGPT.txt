Please write sortwords.exe program in C++. The program will do the following:

1) Combine the content of the three files (F1,F2,F3) into a new file F4.
2) Read the files in different threads. 
3) One thread should read one file (thread per file).
4) All file reader threads must run simultaneously.
5) Another thread will write the content into a file F4.
6) All words in the file F4 should be sorted lexicographically in lower-case. Duplicates (words that appear more than once) should be written to F4 only once. The punctuation marks could be omitted.
7) The program will print the most frequent word in all three files (F1,F2,F3) and its count.
8) The program will ask the user to enter a sorting method as follows: sort [-a, -d], where -a means "ascending" and -d means "descending"
9) The program will ask the user to enter a splitting character to delimit the words in F4 file: split [-s, -c, -n], where -s means "white space", -c means "coma", -n means "new line"
10) The program should be written as efficient as possible.

EXAMPLE OF COMMANDS:
> sortwords.exe "C:\F1.txt", "C:\F2.txt", "C:\F3.txt"
enter your options:
sort -a
split -s
go

F1 content: "Some years ago - never mind how long precisely."
F2 content: "There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs”
F3 content: "Circumambulate the city of a dreamy By Sabbath afternoon."
F4 content: “a, afternoon, ago, as, belted, by, circumambulate, city, coral, dreamy, how, Indian, insular, is, isles, long,
manhattoes, mind, never, now, of, precisely, reefs, round, sabbath, some, the, there, wharves, years, your”

OUTPUT: The most frequent word in all files is 'by', count: 2




Write a program in C++ that does the following:

- Combine the content of 3 files (F1,F2,F3) into a new file F4.
- Read the files in different threads (thread per file) that run simultaneously.
- Another thread will write the content into a file F4.
- All words in file F4 should be sorted lexicographically in lower-case. Duplicates should be written to F4 only once. The punctuation marks could be omitted.
- The program will print the most frequent word in all 3 files (F1,F2,F3) and its count.
- The program will ask the user to enter a sorting method as follows: sort [-a, -d], where -a means ascending and -d means descending
